HPSC 2018 Exercise 1
====================

The code `ex1.cpp` contains the naive implementations of required functions.
One can change `test_sizes` in code to change test problems, use `make` to
compile. Also a Ruby script provided to visualize the performance results,
use `make plot` to run and generate performance figure.

Problem Analysis
====================

1. Norm

2. Matrix-vector product

3. Matrix-matrix multiplication
